You’ve read this number quite fast, and you’re probably not grasping how enormously big that is.
So, what are the implications of this? In this Gallery you can find every single picture (with those properties) that has been taken in the past and that will be taken in the future. It even contains all the pictures that will never be taken. There is a 64x64 grayscale version of every picture you have posted and will ever post on social media, of each planet in the Universe and each species that may or may not live on them. There is also a picture of those keys you lost a few years ago in the exact location they are now. The only hard task is finding them. Good luck!

# Product Design

## SmartBike

**Subtitle**
Electric and foldable, the perfect city bike.

**Description**
SmartBike is a design concept aimed at improving individual mobility at cities. It uses airless tires without spokes that revolve around the static rim. The back wheel has an electric motor with batteries allocated in the tube.
This bike is can fold to occupy the minimum amount of space. Both wheels retract, and the tube folds on its middle. Once folded the wheels align perfectly which allows users to pull the bike instead of carrying it.

**Process**
Smartbike was the final project for the 3D Modeling subject at EINA, University School of Design and Art. It was modeled with SolidWorks and animated using KeyShot. The final images were made using the KeyShot renders and Photoshop.

When needed the screen can be pulled down, which resumes the last session. With this design, the device becomes, portable, multifunctional, and avoids the lack of familiarity that the current design iteration has.

**Process**
HoloLens is a concept project modeled using SolidWorks and animated with KeyShot. It only represents a proof of concept and helps visualize how holographic computers could integrate with currently existing devices.

And when completely folded backwards the device can be used as a tablet.
This concept uses a foldable screen and a 360 hinge to allow its rotation.

**Process**

## Smartwatch

**Subtitle**
A new intuitive way to check the time.

**Description**
Apart from its appearance, the goal behind this project was finding out a new way to display the time. Analogic watches have been around for so long that the position of the needles has become something very intuitive for all of us. On the other hand, digital clocks can display the time in a faster and easier way.
This concept tries to use the best of both worlds by displaying the time digitally in the position the needles would be. Making it intuitive and fast to read.

**Process**
SmartWatch is a project modeled and rendered using SolidWorks for an early project at EINA, University School of Design and Art. The time display method is an original idea animated using Flash Pro.
