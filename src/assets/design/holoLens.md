description:
  [
    'This is concept inspired by the HoloLens device by Microsoft. The holographic screen can be rotated until it disappears when not needed. The headset can be controlled with tactile controls on the right ear-cup as well as hand gestures.',
    'When needed the screen can be pulled down, which resumes the last session. With this design, the device becomes, portable, multifunctional, and avoids the lack of familiarity that the current design iteration has.',
