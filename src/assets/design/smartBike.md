    'SmartBike is a design concept aimed at improving individual mobility at cities. It uses airless tires without spokes that revolve around the static rim. The back wheel has an electric motor with batteries allocated in the tube.',
    'This bike is can fold to occupy the minimum amount of space. Both wheels retract, and the tube folds on its middle. Once folded the wheels align perfectly which allows users to pull the bike instead of carrying it.',
