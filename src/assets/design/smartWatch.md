    'Apart from its appearance, the goal behind this project was finding out a new way to display the time. Analogic watches have been around for so long that the position of the needles has become something very intuitive for all of us. On the other hand, digital clocks can display the time in a faster and easier way.',
    'This concept tries to use the best of both worlds by displaying the time digitally in the position the needles would be. Making it intuitive and fast to read.',
