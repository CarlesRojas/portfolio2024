    'Orbit is a computer screen with three configurations, and some variants. When opened flat it has a 21.2-inch screen that can be placed in a stand to work as a full desktop computer. When opened a quarter of the way, to be used like a laptop, the lower part of the screen will display a keyboard or application specific controls. And when completely folded backwards the device can be used as a tablet.',
